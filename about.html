      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Fabercards, a sincere, convenient way to stay in touch with
        people you enjoy.  <b>Fabercards helps you maintain warm relations with
        those that matter to you most</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        How?
      </p>
      <p>
        By means of a crisp, handmade, and handwritten letter that's delivered
        on time.  With Fabercards you'll stop missing important occasions; we'll
        do the remembering for you.  With Fabercards, you won't have to go to
        grocery store, and then inevitably forget, to grab an overpriced card,
        we deliver the card to you before each occasion so you can send it on
        time.  All you need to do is the important, rather than the boring,
        stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        They say necessity is the mother of invention.  Fabercards is no
        exception.  I recently moved away from my home state of Wisconsin to
        San Diego, California.  With most of my friends and family much farther
        than normal, I desired a way to let them know I'm thinking of them that
        wasn't via the internet or phone.  I find myself distracted and
        overwhelmed by the amount of notifications and alerts I receive via
        the internet platforms I participate in.  Correspondence through a
        facebook message or a text, especially in regards to events like
        birthdays, has always felt more hollow than a card. To cut through all
        of the digital distractions, I started sending simple cards in the mail.
        The ritual of sending someone a card gives me an opportunity to reflect
        on and appreciate who I'm writing too.<br />
        <br />
        <i>However, there were a few problems</i><br />
        <br />
        First, I didn't like the cards I kept finding at grocery stores.  I
        especially didn't like having to pay over 5 bucks for some.  Second,
        I'd frequently run out of stamps, so I'd have to run to the post office
        and grab some more. Third, I'd sometimes forget to send a card enough
        in advance for an occasion.  I kept wishing someone would send me a card
        a few days prior to the occasion, so I could simply add my message
        and then send it along.  I bet since I could benefit from this service
        other people would too.

        via a medium that lets them know he cares.
