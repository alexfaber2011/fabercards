      <h3>We believe:</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
        Well-wishes for occassions like birthdays, anniversaries, and
        achievements that are posted social media have become statistics that we
        use to validate our popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever heard of someone scoffing about the number of birthday
        wishes on someone's wall?  We have.  It's a silly game, so we decided to
        play a more authentic one.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
        Many well-wishes on social media are obligatorily triggered via
        reminders that you did not set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it's always better to wish someone well than not.  However, doing
        so out of obligation and social pressure strips your message of its
        sincerity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever think to yourself: "well a lot of people are posting on Charlie's
        wall, and if I don't he might think less of me."  Send Charlie a note
        if you mean it, and not out of obligation.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
        When we say it with a card, we mean it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the time to sit down and write a card, and packaging it in a nice
        envelope, lets them know you care.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
        Sending a card is a hassel and expensive.  Remembering is problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sending cards is not part of your routine, and paying 5 dollars for a
        mediocre card at a grocery store isn't ideal.  Whoops! You forgot to grab
        stamps, and now the post office is closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your friends' anniversary crept up on you again, and you may not have
        enough time to send them a card anymore.

    <h4>How it Works</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="how-it-works">
      <h4><span class="number">1.</span> Share the date of an occassion with us</h4>
      <p>
        An occasion can be anything!  A friend's birthday, your parents' anniversary,
        or a montly card to help stay in touch with a college buddy.  Simply
        let us know when the occassion is happening and the address.
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">2.</span> We'll send you a card</h4>
      <p>
        We'll deliver to your door a handmade evenlope, already stamped,
        and handmade card about 10 days prior to the date of the occassion.
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">3.</span> Write on it</h4>
      <p>
        Each envelope and card looks and feels great, but your message is what
        makes it special.  Enrich the card with your own custom content:
        handwriting, personal photos, or cash.  Whatever you please!
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">4.</span> Send it</h4>
      <p>
        Once you're done customizing your card, seal the envelope in the card,
        and plop it in the mailbox.  Don't worry about the stamp, we already
        provided you with one remember?  Just raise the little red flag on your
        mailbox and you're done.
