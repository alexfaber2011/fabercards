      <h4 class="text-center">spread some joy</h4>
      <p>
        We all know that little feeling of joy that comes from receiving a
        personal card in the mail from someone you enjoy.  Simplecard makes it
        easy for you to treat them to such a feeling.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h4 class="text-center">avoid unecessary hassle</h4>
      <p>
        You'd like to send a card, but which one? Is that card really worth
        $10? Do you have a stamp?  With simplecard, choosing the right card is
        easy.  Each card is priced appropriately, and the stamp is included.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h4 class="text-center">share value</h4>
      <p>
        Each simple card comes in a hardy, handmade envelope.  The card itself
        is made and decorated by hand.  Each has a simple design as to not
        distract from what matters most, your message.

      <h4><span class="number">1.</span> Share an occassion with us</h4>
      <p>
        An occasion can be anything!  A friend's birthday, a parent's anniversary,
        or a montly card to help stay in touch with a college buddy.
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">2.</span> Let us know how to reach you</h4>
      <p>
        We'll deliver to your door a handmade evenlope, already stamped,
        and handmade card about 10 days prior to the occassion.
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">3.</span> Enrich the card</h4>
      <p>
        Each envelope and card looks and feels great, but your message is what
        makes it special.  Enrich the card with your own custom content:
        handwriting, personal photos, or cash.  Whatever you please!
      </p>
      <h4><span class="number">4.</span> Send it on its merry way</h4>
      <p>
        Once you're done customizing your card, seal the envelope in the card,
        and plop it in the mailbox.  Don't worry about the stamp, we already
        provided you with one remember?  Just raise the little red flag on your
        mailbox and you're done.

          The envelope, like the card, is designed to feel good to hold.  When
          your recipients receive it, they'll surely know it's of value.  When
          the card is sent to you, before you send it its final destination,
          it's wrapped in another handmade evenlope that's crafted from recycled
          scrap paper.
